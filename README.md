Welcome to dermScan! dermScan is an iOS application designed to help users identify their acne type and connect with dermatologists for consultation and prescriptions. 

9.4% of the global population battles acne, and yet 84% of them do not possess proper knowledge about acne problems. To address this issue and assist people in understanding and managing their acne, we have developed dermScan.

## Applications
dermScan consists of two applications:

- **dermScan for Patients**: This application allows users to identify their acne type using an ML model. Users can then choose to consult with dermatologists and send their requests for prescriptions.

- **dermScan for Dermatologists**: This application is tailored for dermatologists to receive consultation requests from patients and provide prescriptions accordingly.

Feel free to explore each branch to access the respective codebase for each application.
